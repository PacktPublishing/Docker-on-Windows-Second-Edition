        <img src="~/Images/nerd.jpg" height="200" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px" alt="Picture of a huge nerd." />Are you a huge nerd? Perhaps a geek? No? Maybe a dork, dweeb or wonk. 
	Quite possibly you're just a normal person. Either way, you're a social being. You need to get out for a bite
	to eat occasionally, preferably with folks that are like you.

        Enter <a href="http://www.nerddinner.com">NerdDinner.com</a>, for all your event planning needs. We're focused on one thing. Organizing the world's
	nerds and helping them eat in packs.
    </p>
    <p>We're free and fun. <a href="~/">Find a dinner near you</a>, or <a href="~/Dinners/Create">host a dinner</a>. Be social.</p>
    <p>
        We also have blog badges and widgets that you can install on your blog or website so your readers can get 
	involved in the Nerd Dinner movement. Well, it's not really a movement. Mostly just geeks in a food court, but still.
